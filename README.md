# üê¶ TWITTER-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS USING MACHINE LEARNING

A machine learning project that analyzes sentiment from tweets to classify them as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. This repository demonstrates the end-to-end pipeline of data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization using Python.

# üìå Project Overview

Social media platforms like Twitter are rich sources of public opinion. This project leverages machine learning techniques to extract sentiment from tweets, enabling businesses and researchers to understand public mood and trends in real time.

# üöÄ Features

- Scrapes tweets using Twitter API or preloaded datasets
- Cleans and preprocesses text data (stopwords removal, tokenization, stemming)
- Converts text to numerical format using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer
- Trains multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM)
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Visualizes sentiment distribution and word clouds
